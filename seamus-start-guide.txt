To get started, you will need to download the Expo XDE.
After that, on the main page select 'Open Project' and select 'Muster-Native'
After that, you can open on a simulated device (top right corner), or download
  the expo app on your iPhone, and scan the QR code you generate by clicking the 
  share button (top left) on the desktop app. 

note: for the on desktop iphone simulator, if you don't have a sohee level comp, 
  you def want to use the iphone 6 or lower for your simulations. 

If you are having trouble setting up the env, talk to seamus. 


STRUCTURE: 

Each folder (besides the persistentComponents) is a different page of the app. 
  These are conditionally rendered from the app.js. 
  The entry point (where data gets passed in from app.js) for each page is the 
  **componentName**Screen.js file. At the top of this component there are maps 
  of which components are subordinate to which components. 



DON'T TOUCH UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES: 
  app.json
