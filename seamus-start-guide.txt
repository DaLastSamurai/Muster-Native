To get started, you will either need to download the Expo XDE (to get access to 
the simulator on your computer), or cd into the root file and npm start.
If you choose to download XDE and work from there: 
  On the main page select 'Open Project' and select 'Muster-Native'
  After that, you can open on a simulated device (top right corner), or download
    the expo app on your iPhone, and scan the QR code you generate by clicking the 
    share button (top left) on the desktop app. 

  note: for the on desktop iphone simulator, if you don't have a sohee level 
  computer you def want to use the iphone 6 or lower for your simulations. 

  If you are having trouble setting up the XDE env, talk to seamus. 

If you choose to cd and npm start, download the expo app on your phone and scan 
  the qr code with the qr scanner. This will open the app. 


STRUCTURE: 

Each folder is a different feature (and page) of the app. 
  These are conditionally rendered from the app.js. 
  The entry point (where data gets passed in from app.js) for each page is the 
  **componentName**Screen.js file. At the top of this component there are maps 
  of which components are subordinate to which components. TODO.
